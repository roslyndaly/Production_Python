# Simple Unit Testing: Exercise

In this exercise, you'll practice writing test cases based off the requirements of a function.

You have been provided with the following files:

- `dicts_and_set_exercises.md`: This file outlines the requirements of six functions.
- `dict_sets.py`: This file contains the source code for the functions described in the requirements.

Your task is to read the requirements of each function and write a unit test for each one. You should structure your project with a source code package containing `dict_sets.py` and a test package containing the six test functions you will create.

**Note**: you are not required to write the source code for the functions; it has already been provided for you in `dict_sets.py`.

Once you have created the six tests, run `pytest` on your project and examine the test report. One of the functions is written incorrectly on purpose for you to find the error. Correct the source code and run the test again.

The project structure should look like:

``` text
dict_sets_project/
│
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── dict_sets.py
│
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_dict_sets.py
```
